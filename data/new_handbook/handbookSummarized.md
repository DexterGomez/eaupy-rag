An introduction to effective altruism, as detailed in the *Effective Altruism Handbook*, presents it as a philosophy and social movement dedicated to using high-quality evidence and careful reasoning to determine the most effective ways to improve the world .

### Core Idea

The central principle of effective altruism is to help others as much as possible by basing decisions on evidence rather than just gut instinct or guesswork . It acknowledges that while many attempts to do good may fail, the most effective interventions can have an exceptional impact . The handbook illustrates this with a comparison of HIV/AIDS interventions, where the most effective strategy, educating high-risk groups, is estimated to be 1,400 times more effective than the least effective one shown .

### Main Goals and Promising Causes

Effective altruism involves carefully selecting which problems to prioritize . The introduction highlights that while significant progress has been made in areas like poverty reduction and human rights, many severe problems persist . A framework is proposed to identify high-impact causes by assessing them based on their scale, neglectedness, and solvability . Based on this reasoning, the following cause areas are identified as particularly promising:

* **Fighting Extreme Poverty** Millions die annually from preventable diseases associated with poverty, like malaria . Simple, cost-effective interventions such as providing antimalarial bednets (around $2.50 each) or direct cash transfers can significantly improve health and opportunities .
* **Animal Suffering** Billions of animals endure inhumane conditions in factory farms each year . Advocates argue that reducing demand for factory-farmed meat or implementing legislative changes are cost-effective ways to avert a tremendous amount of suffering .
* **Improving the Long-Term Future** Given the vast number of potential future generations, ensuring the survival and well-being of humanity is considered extremely important . This involves mitigating existential risks from threats like climate change, nuclear war, and, perhaps most critically, emerging technologies such as advanced artificial intelligence and engineered pathogens . This area is noted as being surprisingly neglected .

Other promising causes mentioned include improving scientific research, mental health treatment in low-income countries, and policy reform in areas like tobacco control and international migration .

### Methodology for Doing Good

To maximize positive impact, effective altruism suggests considering various avenues for contribution:

* **Career Choice** For most people, their career is an enormous resource, averaging over 80,000 hours of work . Instead of just "following your passion," it is recommended to find a job where you can excel and contribute to solving important problems . This could involve direct work as a policy analyst or researcher, or unconventional approaches like "earning to give"—taking a high-earning job to donate a significant portion of your salary . The organization [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) is dedicated to providing guidance on high-impact careers . Current opportunities can be found on this [job board](https://jobs.80000hours.org/) .
* **Donating to Effective Charities** Financial donations offer a flexible way to support effective organizations . People in high-income countries are often in the top 5% of global incomes, presenting a significant opportunity to do good . To identify the most effective charities, resources like [GiveWell's](https://www.givewell.org/) in-depth research, [Effective Altruism Funds](https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds), and grants made by the [Open Philanthropy Project](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/grants) are recommended . Taking a public pledge through organizations like [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) or [The Life You Can Save](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/) can help individuals commit to giving .
* **Getting Involved in the Community** There is a growing global community of people acting on these ideas, with local meet-up groups and conferences .

For those inspired to take action, the handbook suggests to [read more](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/), find a fulfilling career, attend a conference, or join a local group .

Based on the "Promising Causes" section of the *Effective Altruism Handbook*, selecting a cause involves a framework that considers a cause's scale, neglectedness, and solvability . The handbook applies this framework to several key areas, including global health and development, animal welfare, and the long-term future.

### Framework for Selecting a Cause

A cause is considered high-impact to the extent that it is :
* **Great in scale:** It affects a large number of lives by a significant amount .
* **Highly neglected:** Few other people or organizations are working to address the problem .
* **Highly solvable:** Additional resources are likely to make a substantial difference in addressing the issue .

This framework leads to the identification of several promising cause areas, with the understanding that these are best guesses based on current evidence and may change as new information becomes available .

### Key Cause Areas

#### Global Health and Development

The case for focusing on global health and development is built on the immense and preventable suffering caused by extreme poverty .

* **Scale**: In 2013, nearly 800 million people lived below the international poverty line of \$1.90 per day . This leads to millions of deaths annually from preventable diseases like malaria and tuberculosis .
* **Tractability**: Many of the health issues associated with poverty are treatable with cheap and well-understood interventions, such as insecticide-treated bednets for malaria and basic sanitation to prevent diarrhea . The eradication of smallpox, for instance, is estimated to have cost about \$25 per life saved .
* **Neglectedness**: Despite the scale of the problem, OECD governments spend, on average, only 0.32% of their GDP on foreign aid .
* **Evidence**: This cause area is supported by strong evidence, including numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for interventions like the distribution of insecticide-treated bednets and unconditional cash transfers .

#### Animal Welfare

The suffering of animals, particularly in factory farms, is presented as another high-impact cause area .

* **Scale**: Roughly 11 billion animals are raised and slaughtered annually in U.S. factory farms alone, often in conditions that cause extreme suffering . When considering wild animals, the number is even larger, with an estimated 1 to 3 trillion wild fish caught and killed each year for human consumption .
* **Neglectedness**: Animal welfare is significantly neglected, with only about 3% of philanthropic funding in the U.S. going to animals and the environment, and of that, only 1% is directed toward farmed animals, who represent over 99% of domesticated animals .
* **Tractability**: Progress can be made through interventions like corporate campaigns, which have successfully prompted companies to adopt cage-free policies . Persuading individuals to reduce meat consumption is another promising, cost-effective approach .

#### The Long-Term Future

This cause area focuses on ensuring that human civilization flourishes far into the future, given the vast number of potential future lives .

* **Scale**: The potential for future lives is enormous; civilization could continue for a billion years, resulting in trillions of future lives . Even a small probability of enabling space colonization could lead to an immense number of future lives over trillions of years .
* **Neglectedness**: Shaping the long-term future is highly neglected because future generations cannot advocate for their own interests and the problems are often abstract and uncertain .
* **Tractability**: It is possible to influence the long-term future by reducing extinction risks from threats like climate change and advanced technologies, improving global cooperation, and enhancing institutions' decision-making capabilities . Even a small reduction in the probability of human extinction could have an extremely high expected value .

In addition to these, the handbook also lists other promising causes such as biosecurity, effective altruism in government, and addressing risks from artificial intelligence .

### The Future is Vast and Fragile: Prioritizing the Long-Term and Mitigating Existential Risks

According to the *Effective Altruism Handbook*, a core tenet of effective altruism is the profound moral importance of safeguarding the long-term future of humanity. This concept, known as longtermism, posits that the sheer scale of potential future lives grants them immense ethical weight.

The handbook makes a compelling case for focusing on the long-term future by highlighting its enormous potential. Our descendants could number in the trillions and live for vast stretches of time, potentially even colonizing space . Given this, actions that influence the long-term trajectory of civilization can have an exceptionally high expected value, possibly far exceeding the benefits of more immediate concerns . An action that reduces the probability of human extinction by a mere one in a million could translate to an additional 1,000 to 10,000 years of civilization .

Despite its importance, the long-term future is a highly neglected area . This is partly due to cognitive biases like temporal discounting, where outcomes in the distant future are given less weight . However, just as we have expanded our moral circle to reject discrimination based on race or gender, longtermism argues against "time-bias"—ignoring the well-being of future generations simply because they don't exist yet .

**Existential Risks: Threats to Our Potential**

A key component of protecting the long-term future is the mitigation of "existential risks"—threats that could cause the premature extinction of intelligent life from Earth or irreversibly curtail its potential for desirable development .

The handbook identifies several key existential risks:
* **Natural Risks:** These include events like supervolcanoes or asteroid impacts.
* **Anthropogenic Risks:** These are human-caused risks, which many researchers believe are the most pressing. Examples include:
    * **Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The development of superintelligent AI could pose a significant threat if its goals are not aligned with human values . This could lead to a future shaped by non-human values or even catastrophic accidents .
    * **Engineered Pathogens:** Advances in biotechnology, particularly gene-editing, could be misused to create pandemics far more deadly than any natural disease .
    * **Nuclear War and Climate Change:** These are well-known threats that could lead to global catastrophe .

The argument for focusing on existential risks, as articulated by philosopher Nick Bostrom, is that the loss in expected value from an existential catastrophe is so immense that reducing these risks should be a dominant moral consideration . Bostrom proposed the "Maxipok" rule of thumb: to maximize the probability of an "OK outcome," which is any future that avoids existential catastrophe .

However, the handbook also presents nuances to this view. Nick Beckstead argues for a broader focus on "trajectory changes," suggesting that what matters most is ensuring that the path-dependent aspects of the far future go as well as possible . This perspective favors broader interventions like improving education, science, and political systems to enhance our collective wisdom, in addition to targeted risk reduction . An existential catastrophe is an extreme form of a negative trajectory change .

**Strategies for a Better Future**

The handbook outlines several ways to positively influence the long-term future:
* **Direct Work on Risk Reduction:** This involves research and policy work to ensure the safe development of new technologies like AI and biotechnology .
* **Improving Societal Decision-Making:** Enhancing the ability of institutions to make wise decisions can better prepare humanity to handle unforeseen risks .
* **Differential Technological Development:** This principle suggests retarding the development of potentially dangerous technologies while accelerating those that could reduce existential risks .
* **Movement Building:** Growing the effective altruism community can increase the number of people dedicated to working on these crucial issues .

In conclusion, the effective altruism framework presented in the handbook advocates for a paradigm shift in our altruistic efforts. By recognizing the vast potential of the long-term future and the severe threats posed by existential risks, it argues that we have a profound opportunity and responsibility to ensure that humanity not only survives but flourishes for millennia to come.

### The Core Tenets of Effective Altruism: A Summary of the 'Principles' Section

The "Principles" section of the *Effective Altruism Handbook* lays the groundwork for the philosophy of effective altruism, defining it as the practice of "using high-quality evidence and careful reasoning to work out how to help others as much as possible" . This approach emphasizes that while many attempts to do good are ineffective, the most effective interventions can have an exceptionally large positive impact .

A central tenet of effective altruism is the idea of maximization, which involves comparing different ways of doing good to ensure that resources are allocated to the most effective strategies . This concept is illustrated by the principle of "opportunity cost," where choosing one charitable action means forgoing another, potentially more impactful one . For instance, donating to a cause that saves one life for every $500 is presented as an objectively better choice than donating to one that saves a life for every $5,000 . The goal is to distribute resources in a way that helps people as much as possible, similar to how one would rationally choose essential survival gear for a perilous expedition .

The handbook outlines a framework for identifying a "good cause," which is evaluated based on three key criteria:
* **Scale:** The cause affects a large number of lives by a significant amount .
* **Neglectedness:** The problem receives little attention and few resources from others .
* **Tractability (or Solvability):** Additional resources are likely to make a great deal of progress in addressing the problem .

This framework leads to the identification of several promising cause areas, including fighting extreme poverty, improving animal welfare, and safeguarding the long-term future of humanity . The handbook notes that the value of an intervention can be seen as a multiplicative product of the effectiveness of the cause area, the specific intervention, and the organization implementing it .

Furthermore, the principles section delves into more nuanced concepts. "Crucial considerations" are ideas or arguments that can radically alter conclusions about how to direct efforts, potentially leading to a major change in priorities . The "moral value of information" is also highlighted, suggesting that interventions focused on research and gathering data can be highly valuable, as they can lead to better decision-making in the future . This implies that in some cases, it may be better to invest in interventions with less initial evidential support to explore their potential, a concept that contrasts with the intuitive preference for well-established interventions .

For those looking to apply these principles, the handbook provides several resources and avenues for action:
* **Further Reading:** Additional articles on effective altruism can be found at [https://www.effectivealtruism.org/](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) .
* **Charity Evaluators:** For in-depth research on effective charities, particularly in global health, the handbook recommends visiting [GiveWell.org](http://Givewell.org) .
